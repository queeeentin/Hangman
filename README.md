#Simple Hangman Game

#About this project
Hangman is an interactive single-user word guessing game. Winning and losing conditions are animated. Win rate data are given at the end of game session. Our simple game runs on Mac OSX bash command line.

#Dependencies
This project requires at least Python version 2.7.10 pre-installed.
(not mandatory) Pre-installation of MySQL and MySQL Workbench are recommended but not mandatory.

#Installation
Open up your Mac bash command line. Change your directory to "Hangman/projects/skeleton". Run the following command line "python setup.py USERNAME PASSWORD", where USERNAME and PASSWORD are the credentials to your MySQL server. The credentials above are optional. If credentials are given, the python script will automatically populate a word list for the game in your MySQL server. Otherwise, the script will generate a text file to store the word list locally.

#How to run the game
Change directory to "Hangman/projects/skeleton/hangman". Run the following command line "python hangman.py" to start playing.
